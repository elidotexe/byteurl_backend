## About this project

This project is an experimental app I built using Next.js 13 for the frontend and Golang for the backend.

It is a free application that allows users to register an account, create shortened links and track the performance of each link. This includes monitoring click count, device type, browser type, IP addresses and the location of the audience that clicked on the links generated by the application.

### Links

The Links user interface enables you to perform CRUD operations and track the click count for each generated link.

### Analytics

The analytics page allows you to learn about the people who clicked on your link by displaying the monthly performance of your click count, device type, and browser type.

### Geolocation
